# IPTV

You don't need to pay for a TV provider if you can stream videos online (and you have network quota).

- Download [Smart IPTV app](https://siptv.eu/howto/) for your TV
- Activate your TV on [Smart IPTV Activation](https://siptv.eu/activation/) for 5.49 USD (Â Yes, I paid too :[ )
- Upload the playlist with URL: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/suphero/IPTV/master/all.m3u

- I am trying to update the playlist and your app will show updated version :)
